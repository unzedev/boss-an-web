## Commands
So this is a Angular project, generated by the Angular CLI. That being said, there are a few simple commands that will help you to contribute:

To serve the application for development just run `npm start` or `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

To build the application for production run `npm run build --prod` or `ng build --prod`

To run unit tests execute `npm run test` or `ng test`

To run end-to-end tests execute `npm run e2e` or `ng e2e`

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
